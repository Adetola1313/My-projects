    "### INTRODUCTION\n",
    "\n",
    "The development process for this task involved several step to develop a set of functions to read, analyse, and output data from a CSV file. Specifically, the functions were designed to calculate the Spearman’s Rank Correlation Coefficient between all pairs of columns in a CSV file, and to output a custom table displaying a subset of these correlation coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "### PROCESS\n",
    "\n",
    "Development Process:\n",
    "\tFunction to find the geometric mean: The first function developed was to find the geometric mean of a Python list. The function was designed to take a list as input and return the geometric mean. The function was tested using the data file called task1.csv,and was found to work correctly.\n",
    "   Function to read a single specified column of data from a CSV file: The next function developed was to read a single specified column of data from a CSV file. The function was designed to take three parameters: the data file name, a column number, and a conversion indicator. The function was tested using the data file called task1.csv,and was found to work correctly.\n",
    "\tFunction to read CSV data from a file into memory: The third function developed was to read all columns of data from a CSV file and add them to a dictionary data structure. The function was designed to take two parameters: the data file name and a list of conversion indicators. The function made use of the previously developed function to read a single specified column of data from a CSV file.The function was tested using the data file called task1.csv,and was found to work correctly.\n",
    "\tFunction to calculate the Spearman’s Rank Correlation Coefficient: The fourth function developed was to calculate the Spearman’s Rank Correlation Coefficient for two lists of data. The function was designed to take two lists of data (of equal length) as input, and return the calculated coefficient value. The function was tested using the data file called task1.csv,and was found to work correctly.\n",
    "\tFunction to generate a set of Spearman’s Rank Correlation Coefficients: The fifth function developed was to generate a set of Spearman’s Rank Correlation Coefficients for a given data file. The function made use of the previously developed function to calculate the Spearman’s Rank Correlation Coefficient for two lists of data. The function was tested using the data file called task1.csv,and was found to work correctly.\n",
    "\tFunction to print a custom table: The final function developed was to print a custom table of Spearman’s Rank Correlation Coefficients for a subset of the column pairs generated in the previous function. The function was designed to take three parameters: a list of correlation coefficient tuples, a border character to use, and which columns to include. The function made use of the Python string formatting capabilities to improve the readability of the output. The function was tested using the data file called task1.csv. \n",
    "\n",
    "### CONCLUSION\n",
    " In conclusion, a set of functions was successfully developed to read, analyze, and output data from a CSV file. The functions were tested using provided CSV files and manually created data lists, and were found to work correctly. The functions developed provide a foundation for future data analysis projects.\n"
