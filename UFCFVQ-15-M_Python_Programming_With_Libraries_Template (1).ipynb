    "## INTRODUCTION\n",
    "The development process for this task involved several steps,which included reading in the data from two CSV files, merging them into a single dataframe, cleaning and filtering the data,\n",
    "Investigating the effects of engagement on attainment,\n",
    "Testing the hypothesis that engagement has some effect on levels of attainment ,investigating the effects of gender on levels of attainment and then testing if there is any difference between the attainment of male and female students.\n",
    "\n",
    "## PROCESS\n",
    "Firstly, I read in the data from the two CSV files using the pandas library. I then merged the two dataframes into a single dataframe based on the 'id_student' column.\n",
    "Next, I removed any rows from the merged data that contained a missing value in any column and removed the unnecessary columns such as region, final_result, and highest_education. I also filtered out unnecessary rows by removing all rows where click_event is greater than 20000 and any duplicate rows based on id_student.\n",
    "\n",
    "After cleaning and filtering the data, I proceeded to investigate the effects of engagement on attainment using a scatter plot. The scatter plot revealed a positive correlation between engagement and attainment. This suggests that students who have higher click events tend to have higher scores.\n",
    "I then tested the hypothesis that engagement has some effect on levels of attainment by performing a  Pearson correlation test between click_events and score.The results showed that there is a statistically significant relation between engagement and attainment.\n",
    "Afterwards, i investigated the effects of gender on levels of attainment using a box plot. The box plot showed if there is any difference in attainment between males and females. I then performed an independent t-test to determine if there is any difference between the attainment of male amd female students.And the results showed that there is a  significant difference in attainment between the  males and females students.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the development process for this task was straightforward, and the pandas library made it easy to read in and manipulate the data. The use of visualisation tools such as scatter plots and box plots helped to identify patterns and trends in the data, while the t-test allowed for testing if there is any difference between the male and female students. \n",
    "\n",
    "One challenge that i faced during the development process was identifying and removing duplicate rows based on the 'id_student' column. It was necessary to do this to ensure that the data was accurate and that the results were not skewed by duplicate data. Another challenge was determining which columns were unnecessary and could be removed from the dataframe without losing valuable information.\n",
    "\n",
    "## CONCLUSION\n",
    "In conclusion, this task provided an opportunity to practice data cleaning, filtering, and manipulation, as well as data visualisation and statistical testing. Through this process, I gained valuable insights into the data and was able to draw meaningful conclusions about the effects of engagement and gender on levels of attainment.\n"
